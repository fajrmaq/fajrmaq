### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fajr, a second-year computer science student at the University of Connecticut.

I'm primarily interested in cybersecurity, but also software design and development along with front-end web development! 

I'm looking to get more involved and am actively searching for internships for this upcoming summer!

Outside of school, i'm interested in keeping up with the latest fashion trends. I also enjoy painting and listening to music!

#### Let's connect!
